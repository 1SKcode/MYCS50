Times:

10 simulations: 0m0.020s
100 simulations: 0m0.023s
1000 simulations: 0m0.032s
10000 simulations: 0m0.119s
100000 simulations: 0m1.001s
1000000 simulations: 0m10.111s

Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: I thought that with each multiplication of the number by 10, the time would naturally grow by about 10 times more

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:
It seems to me that the golden mean is at 10000-20000 simulations
