So, this week I finished lab work No. 7 and here I want to reflect on the questions posed:

    1. If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
    2. Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very
    representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?

I got acquainted with the sources and went a little deeper into the topic of sound aura.
If we summarize the information we have read, then:
Energy: An indicator of how active and energetic music is.
    This can be expressed through tempo, instrumentation, and overall brightness.
Valence: Reflects the emotional coloring of music,
    from positive (happiness, joy) to negative (sadness, longing).
Danceability: Reflects how well the music is suitable for dancing.
    This is due to the rhythm and structure of the composition.

MY SONG ANALYSIS:

High Energy: "Plug Walk," "SICKO MODE," "HUMBLE."
Medium Energy: "Perfect Duet," "Perfect," "One Kiss."
Low Energy: "Changes," "Happier," "Silence."
Positive Valence: "Happy," "Promises," "Congratulations."
Neutral Valence: "Thunder," "Believer," "In My Blood."
Negative Valence: "SAD!," "Lucid Dreams," "Happier."
Danceable: "Dura," "Taki Taki," "Havana."
Less Danceable: "Changes," "Happier," "Silence."

MY HYPOTHESIS:
    On this set of 100 songs, it is impossible to accurately
    draw conclusions about the sound aura solely on the statistics of
    energy, valence and dance. You also need to take into account:
    The variety of flavors
    Personal preferences
    Dynamic mood: The sound aura can change depending on the mood of the listener at a particular time.
