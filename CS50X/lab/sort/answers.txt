sort1 uses: bubble sort
How do you know?: As the number of numbers increases, time grows at a quadratic rate.
A distinctive feature of the bubble algorithm: a pre-sorted array can be determined by a permutation counter

sort2 uses: merge sort

How do you know?: The distinctive feature of this algorithm is its speed! The speed of n log n is clearly traceable in comparison with sorting 5 thousand elements and 50 thousand.

sort3 uses:selection sort

How do you know?: I realized that this is a selection sort due to the same sorting
timeof the reverse array and the already sorted array. Thus, the notation of theta large will be quadratic.
